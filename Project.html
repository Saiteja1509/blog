    <h2> Car Drowsiness Detection </h2>
    

    <p> Nowadays, road accidents have become one of the major issues. The major road accidents are caused due to drowsiness, drunken and rash driving. This is the reason, every year the number of road accidents is increasing especially by cars . Due to drowsiness, drivers become less active while driving .In order to detect fatigue or drowsiness ,web camera has been used which points directly towards driverâ€™s face and detects the eye movement of the driver. 
        The DDS employs a non-intrusive approach, utilizing a camera mounted inside the vehicle to continuously capture the driver's facial expressions and movements. Machine learning algorithms, trained on a diverse dataset, analyze key facial features such as eye closure, head position, and blink rate to determine the driver's alertness level. The system adapts to individual differences in facial characteristics, making it versatile and applicable across a wide range of drivers.
        To validate the effectiveness of the proposed DDS, extensive testing was conducted in simulated and real-world driving scenarios. The results demonstrate high accuracy in detecting drowsiness, with minimal false positives. The system's sensitivity to subtle changes in driver behavior contributes to its reliability in diverse driving conditions and environments.
        The Drowsiness Detection System presented in this paper represents a significant step towards enhancing road safety by addressing the critical issue of driver drowsiness. As automotive technology continues to evolve, integrating such intelligent safety systems has the potential to reduce accidents and save lives, making roads safer for everyone.</p>
    <h1> Project 2</h1>
    <h2> Vechile Detection and Counting </h2>
    

    <p>Vehicle detection and counting are essential tasks in transportation engineering and intelligent transportation systems. In this project, we present a system for detecting and counting vehicles in real- time video streams using OpenCV in Python. Our system uses a deep learning-based object detection model, YOLOv3, to detect vehicles in each frame of the video. We then track the detected vehicles using the DeepSORT algorithm, which is a simple online and real-time tracking algorithm. Finally, we count the number of vehicles in each frame and calculate the traffic flow rate.</p>
